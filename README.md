# Computing With Neural Manifolds Tutorial
The exercises in this repository are designed to accompany Prof. SueYeon Chung's lectures on Computing with Neural Manifolds at the 2025 [IAIFI Summer School](https://iaifi.org/phd-summer-school.html). The `main` branch contains notebooks with incomplete code, with sections for you to fill in as you work through them. If at any point you need solutions, you can see them in the `solutions` branch.

## Getting set up
Ideally you should clone this repo somewhere where you have access to a GPU, as tutorials 2 and 3 involve training/evaluating some large-ish neural networks. 


## The tutorials

1. **Tutorial 1**: implementing the mean-field calculations of manifold capacity, radius, and dimension. Doesn't require
